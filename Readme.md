# 🎬 Movie Recommendation Engine

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation Engine** that suggests movies based on various machine learning algorithms. The system utilizes:
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, etc.)**
- **Perceptron**
- **Bayesian Methods**
- **Content-Based Filtering**

The goal is to provide **personalized movie recommendations** based on user preferences, movie attributes, and past interactions.

## 🚀 Features
✔ **Machine Learning-Based Recommendations**  
✔ **Genre & Content Similarity Matching**  
✔ **Scalability for Large Datasets**  
✔ **Customizable Model Selection**

## 🏗️ Algorithms Used

### 1️⃣ **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Finds similar users/movies based on feature proximity.
- Provides quick recommendations using distance metrics (Euclidean, Cosine, etc.).

### 2️⃣ **Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, etc.)**
- Groups similar movies together.
- Useful for segmenting users with similar tastes.

### 3️⃣ **Perceptron (Neural Network Approach)**
- Simple neural network model to classify user preferences.
- Can be extended to deep learning models.

### 4️⃣ **Bayesian Methods**
- Uses probabilistic models to predict user preferences.
- Implements **Naïve Bayes Classifier** for recommendation.

### 5️⃣ **Content-Based Filtering**
- Uses movie metadata (genre, director, actors) to recommend similar movies.
- Employs **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.
